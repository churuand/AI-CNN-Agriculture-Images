# Algricultural pests recognition with image data
## About the Project
In the realm of agriculture, combating pests is pivotal to safeguarding crop yields and farm productivity. Timely and precise pest detection is essential but traditionally labor-intensive. Our project introduces an automated system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of five common agricultural pests: Ants, Bees, Grasshoppers, Moths, and Wasps. The dataset comprises 2,479 real images. We evaluate our models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, categorical cross-entropy loss, Kappa Score, precision, recall, and F1-scores."
